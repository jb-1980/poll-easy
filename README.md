# Poll easy

This is my attempt at the [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) voting app basejump.

### Features

-Allows for local user authentication
-Allows authenticated user to simply create a poll
-Allows authenticated user to define poll as private, so it will only be accessible by the url
-Allows authenticated user to delete their polls
-Allows user to view list of all public polls
-Allows user to view results of polls in a graphical representation
-Allows user to respond to a poll
-Poll view provides link to share with other users

### Todos
I would consider:
-Creating a method to track user input so a single user is not responding the same to a poll multiple times
  -The difficulty is that how do I leave it open for all users but restrict their responses? Maybe cookies?
-Make polls list searchable. If the list got long, then it would become a big chore to find a poll. Maybe a search box on the view polls page.
